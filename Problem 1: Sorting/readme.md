I have solved the sorting problem with 2 condition
each condition implement the insertion sort. 
- Explanation about the condition :
condition 1 is with user input array data number. and condition 2 is the array number is already declared.
- So the program run with the array data, and then from that data the number is sorten by increment or decrement. with the process of sorting, the visual data also shown with it. it will be loop until all of the number data is sorted.
